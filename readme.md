# Choosecountryeras

Create some cards, then 2 button to choose between Old and New Country.

Move the card from the origin container to the new divs for each catagory.

TODO: refactor code so that the buttons work for moving the content back and forth from origin container to Old or New Country, and then the remove button resets the card back to the parent container.
